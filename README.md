PROJECT SUMMARY:


We will be implementing a program that will organize basketball team’s information 
using hash tables. Each team will be established with their names, win/lose ration, 
ranking and its roster. Once teams are added to the table we will begin to update 
their wins and loses accordingly. Once we have enough teams in the data structure 
we will be able to rank individual teams according to their streak. We will be able 
to simulate games using roster line ups and each player’s performance level.

HOW TO RUN:

1) Extract "Final Project.zip" to your allocated directory.

2) Assemble project by opening "Final.cpb" (CodeBlocks)

3) Now code may be run using CodeBlocks Build & Compile tool.

4) You will be able operate our program using menue options 1-9
